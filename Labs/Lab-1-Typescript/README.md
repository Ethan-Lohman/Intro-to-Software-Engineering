Create a simple UI using the in-memory database.

Work with your coding partner to implement enough of the SimpleDB object to enable users to add students to the list.

BONUS:

If you finish this task early (likely!) think about

1. What other methods of SimpleDB could you implement?
2. Can you sort the student display by student name? or gpa? 
3. What UI would sorting require?
4. What would you need to implement "delete"?
5. What other UI enhancements would be helpful?
6. How could you test any of this?
