# Project 01 Fall 2023 SWEN-200

This project is a quick introduction to Typescript, and a simple "mini" database.

The idea is to edit the methods of the SimpleDB class to make the tests pass. Study the methods of the Array and Object built-in classes:

https://javascript.info/object

The project will be evaluated based on style/quality (40%) and function (60%).

You can find the code in the `src` directory. Just edit the code in `index.ts` to make the tests pass. You can run the tests yourself once you have node installed by `cd`ing to the root of the repository and typing:

    yarn test
    
See the comments in `src/index.ts`, and see the tests in `src/simple.spec.ts` to infer the expected behavior of the methods.

when you have all the tests passing, then commmit:

    git commit -m "I got it to work!" -a

Then push:

    git push

That's it!

Enjoy.
