This final project was for improving this site: [Glowscript](https://www.glowscript.org/#/)

These were the following goals:
- Implement the Monaco Editor.
- Integrate Google Drive to the editor.
- Have screenshots to be automatic.
- Refactor code to make it more managable for the future.

What I was assigned was to implement the Monaco Editor and integrate the google drive with the editor. This I was able to do. As of now the changes are not pushed to the main repo, but will be by the professor.
