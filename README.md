# Intro-to-Software-Engineering
This showcases the work I have one in my class, 'Intro to Software Engineer', taken during the Fall semester of 2023.

- Labs: Pair-programming projects that gave us an introduction of a software engineering concept or technology.
- Projects: Individual projects that gave a more complex understanding of a software engineering concept or technology. With a final project with goals of improving a website called glowscript.
- Exams: Two exams, a mid-term that went over projects 1-4, and a Final that went over software ethics, merging, and design choices.
